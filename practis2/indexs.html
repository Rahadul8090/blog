    <p>1.How does react work?</p>
    <p>Ans: React is without a doubt one of the most powerful and flexible frontend frameworks. But with its great power
        comes great responsibility – it’s easy to misuse it and create a mess of an app. To avoid it, one needs to
        really understand how React works internally by studying its code implementation and structure.</p>
    <p>2.Different between props</p>
    <P>Different between props and states
        The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself
        while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.
